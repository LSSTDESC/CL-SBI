Effect of noise in r-m relation on calculated concentration

* Define richness band of interest
* Draw log10masses within that richness band
* Add some positive noise (and negative noise to another copy of the samples)
* Find the concentration for these noisy masses
* Plot the concentration for these noisy masses vs the concentration for the noiseless masses

'''
Effect of noise in r-m relation on inferred concentration

* Define richness band of interest
* Draw log10masses within that richness band
* Add some positive noise (and negative noise to another copy of these samples)
* Find the concentration for these noisy masses
* Generate NFW profiles
* Run inference
* See how inferred concentration differs for the negative noise, no noise, positive noise cases
